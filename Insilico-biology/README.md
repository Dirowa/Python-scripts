This is the part of my insilico tentame.\
This assignment is mixed with python scrypts and shell scripts

The casus:\
there are 4 genes where 1 one of genes is able to produce a heat resistance protein in the batch of a chemostat\
the question is which possible genes is it and what can is do?

As first is the suspected genome with the tool Augustes translated to protein sequences.\
where a python scrypt is used to get it in an usable fasta format.
To select the ones who are exstracellulair SingalP must be detected.\
Only SignalP can only handle one sequence at a time. so the fasta file created is parsed into mutliple files containing one protein sequence\
